He worked at Sun Yee Yee Rest at 15 Doyers Street.  Then at Kwong Ching Chong Store Mott Street for five years and then for 2 years when it moved to 20 Pell Street.  Worked at other restaurant and then started with Kwong Sun Chong (Chinese good store) at 30 Mott Street, where he worked at time of application. 
Note: Chue (Cue) Kue Yok was interviewed, he is the manager of the Kwong Sun Chong Co. Store at 30 Mott Street where the applicant CKY works (not a restaurant.)  I did NOT count him as a Chinese witness because he is not a restaurant manager chinese witness.   (Is this correct?) ",Lucy Asako Boltz

In 1917, he went to China again with a LRC, after trying to get a passport based on his birth U.S (and not getting a response quickly enough). He applied for a CRC in 1919-1920 and left again for China for his 5th trip to China, and returned in 1920. Sometime before this trip, JB had remarried in US (his first wife died a while back).

So I assumed that father was citizen by birth. In 1924, he said he was born in Ark Lung Lee, and in 1930 he said he was born in Dak Lun Lee Village. I have to change entry to Ark Lung Lee based on this application entry of 1924. Although there was no re-entry form to list children, he did later report that he had his second child born Jan 9 1925. And third was born March 9, 1926. He returned sometime in 1925, so he would have had 2 children at this point. That's how I filled in that information.  Also, as for MGG's father's business location, the father was living with his wife and other son (MGG's brother) in Corning, NY at time of MGG's 1924 CRC application. He may have had a business there. I put that place as his business location in order to locate him in a place in the US for which we have evidence.   ",Lucy Asako Boltz

There is no re-entry interview or form. There are letter of request to reenter through Seattle, Washington, but no approval for that. Later in 1935, Lee Bing was arrested in Hartford, Connecticut, and investigated for violation of the federal Narcotic Laws by the U.S. Department of Labor office in Boston. He was sentenced to imprisonment for 6 months, but as the sentence was suspended, no steps could have been taken by the Boston office looking to his deportation.

The U.S. Department of Labor was not able to locate any information about Lee Bing’s initial admission with his father at Malone N.Y. in 1893, as he claimed.

Total capitalization of the restaurant- in the interview he said “eleven hundred thousand”, but the word ‘hundred’ seems deleted with a line on it. I assumed it to be a mistake and that the right answer is “eleven thousand,” as he invested seven hundred and has 15 partners.

Names of witnesses on the 431 form do not match names of witnesses in the interviews. On the 341 form: Mr. James T. Smith, 74 Kearney Ave. and Mr. Louis S. Janssen 76 Kearney Ave. In the interviews: James R.

Alien Registration Number: 2-645-809

Certificate Identification Number: 42526

The applicant has been part of the Chinese Hand Laundry investigation in 1953.

First entry port: in the interview the applicant said New York, but in later documents it is said to be San Francisco, California.

Number of partners: in the interview before leaving the applicant said 15 partners, in the interview when returning said 13 (and gave details about active members and their positions). I used the numbers from the returning interview because there were more details.

Date of investment: in the 431 form said 11/15/1918, in the interview said 11/16/1918.

Total capital: in the interview before leaving, the applicant said the total capitalization is $10,500, but in the interview when returning he said that each member invested $1,000.

Witnesses: the witness Harry M. Thompson relation with the applicant is not clear. All that is mentioned is that he lives above the restaurant. I marked it as if he is a customer. The relation with the witness William Chambers is also unclear- he is a chauffeur of a company, said that he delivers good to the restaurant. Not clear if he is a grocer or supplier. I marked it as supplier as he did not say what kind of goods.

Lastly, the name of the witness listed in the application form 431 does not match the witness that was actually interviewed. The one from application is Charles F.

Applicant's wife CI: 31463

Address of residence in the U.S.: 139 or 140 West 49th St., New York City, New York.

Inspector name: the name of the inspector that conducted the interviews is L. B. Reynolds, as I wrote in this form. However, another inspector signed the approval and other documents- A. W. Brough.

Home address: I inserted the address the applicant said he will stay at during the visit, in Hong Kong.

Reentry information: there is no file or document for the reentry of the applicant, therefore I inserted that the information is missing. However, the intended port of entry was Seattle, and in the interview the applicant and his wife said they intend to have a short trip of 3 or 4 weeks. I also assume that his status in reentry is still citizen, but wrote missing because no information is given.

The applicant applied for return certificate for a trip with his wife and his young son. They were all approved.

The applicant's father lives in the U.S. with his wife and 6 other children (step mother and siblings).

There was an issue with the documents of the son- the name and sex of the child was different on the form submitted by the broker and the name was also different on the birth certificate.
They also had issues with stating different numbers of children they had at different times. One of their sons born in China, one in the states that died after a few days, and one in the states that is traveling with them and had a different name on the birth certificate.",Nofar Hamrany

Application final approval: was approved by New York on 10/21/1919, which told to Seattle to approve it. Seattle approved it on 10/27/1919. I inserted the New York date in this form.

Number of waiters in the restaurant: 2 usually, 3 during the winter. I inserted 3 in this form.

Witness relationship: the witness Bernard Green knows the applicant from working in the same building. I classified his as costumer for the lack of better option.

Port of exit and entrance on the application: it was originally typed to be SF, but crossed off and written with pen on top to be Seattle. I wrote SF in this form.

Exit and reentry information: there are no documents in the file regarding the applicant actually exiting the US and coming back. I wrote missing on everything there, but I assume his status of merchant and family status might have not changed before he left at least. Should I change that in this form?",Nofar Hamrany

The applicant was investigated in January and October 1918 for his merchant status, related to an admission request for his alleged son from China. His status of merchant was confirmed, but his alleged son was denied admission because of discrepancies as to their relationship. This alleged son is not mentioned in the interviews, so I wrote that numbers of sons and children are missing.

The applicant has money invested in other restaurant in New York City as well.

Dividends: the applicant said the dividends he received the previous year in USD and not percentage. I calculated it to percentage as of percentage of yearly sales (monthly sales x 12 = $6000 x 12 = $72,000 , he received $5000 in dividends, which is about 6.94% of $72,000)

The applicant's birthday or age is not stated clearly, but in one document from 1919 it is requested that his age on the document will be changed from 31 to 43.",Nofar Hamrany

Was arrested on 161 Ralph Avenue, Brooklyn, New York. Charge: being unlawfully within the US. Initial bail was set for $1000, but after after a few appeals the bail was $2500.

Application approved/denied and appeal: in this form I referred to the application submitted date as the day he was arrested, and for the result being approved as being approved that he will be deported. However, he submitted an appeal for that (many times), so in this form it says that the application was both approved and appealed. The final date of the application's decision is that final time his appeal was denied and the deportation was approved.

First Entry: he doesn't remember when or where it was, but said he was a child and came with his father. He does remember living in New York when he was 9-10 years old. I left this information as missing in the form because it is not clear if his first arrival was to New York and how old he was.

Restaurant: he only says that he worked in laundries and restaurants, but doesn't mention any details about a specific restaurant. He said he's started working when he was 25 (1894), but not clear if this is the time when he started working in a restaurant or laundry place.",Nofar Hamrany

He was hospitalized upon arrival for clonorchiasis.

Year of birth: gave different ages in different interview that don't match the same year. I put the earliest year in this form, making him the oldest possible.

Restaurant:
The restaurant name has been written differently in different documents: Mee Joe Low, Mee Jew Low, or Mee Jow Low.
Mentioned he is sometime in charge of buying, but he is mainly the manager.
His interest is stated to be 2000. He initially invested 2500 but then sold 500 to someone else. In this form, I wrote that his investment is 2500 and the date of the initial investment. Let me know if I need to change it to his current interest.

Witnesses:
The witness Harry D. Gilbert said he knows him fro 5 years, but the applicant said 2 years. I write 5 years in this form.
The witness Samuel E. Frank Spyree said he knows him for 8 or 10 years. I wrote 10 in this form.
One of the witnesses details of the restaurant amount of tables and waitress were different than the applicant's details. I wrote the details given by the applicant in his interview in this form.

Active Partners: one of them is an assistant manager. For the lack of a fitting option in this form, I marked him as Misc.

Previous Applications: he had two other applications before, both denied. In one of them, his certificate of identity was taken away from him. I submitted another form for his previous application in 1921. However, I did not submit another form for his application in 1914 because at that time he was not related to a restaurant. Let me know if I need to fill a form for that too.

Lee Leung's words in the hearing were quite contradictory to the interview with A. B. Wiley.

Firstly, Lee Leung stated that he was 45 years old in the interview (he also stated that he was 43 in documents filed in 1914), but in the hearing, he said he was 53 years old. Lee Leung justified in the hearing that he didn't understand Mr. Wiley's question as he was in a hurry in the interview, however, this justification cannot explain the document in 1914.

Secondly, in the interview, he claimed that he first entered US directly from Hong Kong to Boston, and got the paper from Tai Chong's store in Boston, while in the hearing, he claimed that he first entered US from Havana and got the paper from his friend in Havana.

The attorney didn't mention the third questionable point. Lee Leung stated that he wasn't married, while in the hearing he said he was married and has one son, and Ng Fook is his marriage name (So I wrote ""Missing"" in the Martial Status at the time of application and number of children at the time of application.

The man was discharged on June 1st in 1916.",Lichen Dong

Restaurant:
One of the active partners is referred to as an assistant manager, bookkeeper and treasurer. I classified him in this form as a treasurer because his position in the list of partners and their investments is Assistant Manger and Treasurer, and there is no option of assistant manager in this form.
The applicant said in an interview that there are usually 8 employee (including him), but he did not say how many cooks/waiters and how many of them are partners or not. Therefore, I wrote 'Missing' in those parts in the form.
The applicant also worked at other restaurants before the one at the time of the application, but he had no interest in them.

Applicant's Father: in this form. I wrote the father's business as the one he was involved with when the applicant first arrived to the US, but it is also mentioned that he was later involved in another business- Chung Kee Store, 9 Pell Street, NYC.

Number of Entries/Exits: there are no documents in the folder regarding the applicant's exit/entry following this application. For this reason, I wrote that the applicant's number of entries is 1 (only his first entry) and number of exit 1 (I assume he did leave as a result of this application).

Number of Children: one boy that was adopted by his wife. I included him in the counting as a son. Let me know if I should change that.

The applicant claims to have registered in the military registration in 1917-1918, but has no proof.",Nofar Hamrany

Representative: first mentioned Henry A. Monroe, but then James V. Storey. As Storey handled his case in the letters in this folder, I wrote his name in this form.

Inspector and Interpreter: the ones who interviewed the father and his witnesses to prove he is a merchant were different- P. A. Donahue and Sing Kee. In this form I wrote the ones who interviewed the applicant himself.

Witnesses:
Two of the witnesses do not fit the categories in this form- one is a plumber and the other in the laundry business. I categorized them as costumers in this form.
The Chinese witness Yee Set testified for the applicant himself (the other two witnesses were white witnesses testifying for the father's status as a merchant). His relation is that he transferred a letter from the applicant to his father.

Level of Schooling: unclear, but stated that he studied from the age of 9 until leaving China to enter the US (about 12 years). Therefore, level of schooling could be high school or college. Because it is unclear, I wrote missing in this form.

Reentry Information: I wrote missing in this form, but it is actually N/A as this form is for a first entry application as the adopted son of a merchant.

Restaurant Details: the details in this form are for the restaurant the applicant's father managed at the time of this application.

*The applicant worked at two restaurants after being admitted to the US from this application. He worked as a cook for a few months at a restaurant on Rockaway Beach, and also had an interest there of $200. Then he worked as a cook at University Restaurant, 180th Street near Jerome Avenue in NYC.

*The applicant had a trip to China on a laborer status in 1930-31, but he did not work at a restaurant at that time. He was hospitalized and unemployed when returned.

*The applicant was deported from the US to China on April 1, 1932, on the ground that he had become a public charge within five years after his entry, from causes existing prior to landing.",Nofar Hamrany

Application approved: in one letter between inspectors it says it was approved on 11/27/1923, but on the 431 form it says 11/26/1923. I wrote it in this form according to the 431 form.

Restaurant:
Number of waiters is 3, but said they have 4 or 5 on the weekends. I wrote 3 in this form.
Number of kitchen stuff is 4 and have 2 or 3 extra employee on the weekend. I wrote 3 in this form (4 minus 1 cook who is a partner).
Investment and position starting date is April 1922 according to the forms of this application, but he actually already invested 1000 in this restaurant and started working as a manager on 5/1/1914 (mentioned in previous application). Because he was in China from about 1920 until 12/28/1921, he resumes his position as manager only on April 1920, and his interest in the restaurant changed as well.
Dividends- said none delared yet, but that he got 1000 Chinese money in dividends in April 1921 when he was in China. In the previous application in 1920 he said he received 50% in dividends.

Number of exits/entries: did not mention if he exited the US before his application in 1920 or not, so I wrote the numbers on this form as if that was his first exit.

Return date: in one firm says his son, who arrived with him, was admitted on 12/7/1925, but there is a letter from 11/19/1925 stating that they already arrived. As the date of return not clear, I just wrote the year in this form.

Witnesses: the applicant said he knows the witness Jon Nagle for 4-5 years, but the witness said he knows him for 2 year. I wrote 2 years in this form according to what the witness said in his interview.

Previous application: had a previous application that resulted in a trip in 1920. There is another form for it.

His given name is Ling Quan.

First Entry: the applicant said he first came to the US as part of the Philadelphia Exposition, but has no proof.

Family: the applicant was married before but his wife died, so I wrote that he was single at the time of the application. He also said that he has an adopted son that his wife adopted in China, so I wrote that he has 1 child (1 son) in this form.

Application Approval: on the 431 form it says it was approved on 10/26/1923, but it a letter it says it was approved on 10/30/1923. I wrote 10/26/1923 in this form, according to the information on the 431 form.

Reentry: there are no documents about the applicant's return from this trip, but it is stated in one of the documents that he got a Certificate of Identity issued in Seattle on 4/19/1924. Therefore, I assumed he returned in 1924 to Seattle, and wrote that in this form.

Number of Exits and Entries: there are no details if there were previous trips or not, so I wrote in this form that the total number of exits and entries is missing.

Restaurant:
Position: before investing in the restaurant and becoming a manager, the applicant worked as a waiter in the restaurant.
Interest: on the 431 form it says his interest is 1000, but in the interview he said it is 3000, and said that there is a mistake in the form. Therefore, in this form I wrote his investment is 3000.
Number of Tables: he said in an interview that the restaurant has 36 tables, but the inspector who checked the restaurant said there were 27 tables. I wrote 36 tables in this form, according to the applicant's interview.
Salary: the applicant said and showed that his salary is 100 during the summer and 90 during the winter. I wrote 100 in this form, to go with the highest salary.
Monthly Receipts: the applicant said the restaurant's business in the previous year was 19000, so I divided it by 12 to get the monthly receipts.
Dividends: the applicant said that the previous year's dividends were 2100 profit that was divided among the partners according to their interest. Because it is too difficult to calculate, I wrote in this form that the information about dividends is missing.

Witnesses: the number of years the witnesses know the applicant that they said and the applicant said don't match. For James Mitchell, the applicant said he knows him for 4 year. For Louis Newman, the applicant said he know him for 10 years. I wrote the number of years in this form according to the information the witnesses gave.

Citizenship and status at reentry: previous application (1923) said he is a Chines merchant, but now in admission document said ""returning natives"" about him and his children that returned. The children were US citizens, so it is not clear if it was generalized in the document or if he was considered as a citizen/native before he left.

First Entry: the applicant said he first came to the US as part of the Philadelphia Exposition, but has no proof.

Family: the applicant was married before but his wife died (from previous application). In this case it says that he is traveling with his wife and 6 children.

Reentry: it is mentioned that the applicant did not intend to return to the US from this trip, but there are documents showing he returned 13 years later.

Number of Exits and Entries: there are no details if there were previous trips or not besides the one from 1923, so I wrote in this form that the total number of exits and entries is missing, but should be at least 2 exists and 3 entries.

Restaurant:
*The details of the restaurant in this form are based on the details he gave for his application in 1923. There are no details about a restaurant during this application.
Position: before investing in the restaurant and becoming a manager, the applicant worked as a waiter in the restaurant.
Interest: on the 431 form it says his interest is 1000, but in the interview he said it is 3000, and said that there is a mistake in the form. Therefore, in this form I wrote his investment is 3000.
Number of Tables: he said in an interview that the restaurant has 36 tables, but the inspector who checked the restaurant said there were 27 tables. I wrote 36 tables in this form, according to the applicant's interview.
Salary: the applicant said and showed that his salary is 100 during the summer and 90 during the winter. I wrote 100 in this form, to go with the highest salary.
Monthly Receipts: the applicant said the restaurant's business in the previous year was 19000, so I divided it by 12 to get the monthly receipts.
Dividends: the applicant said that the previous year's dividends were 2100 profit that was divided among the partners according to their interest. Because it is too difficult to calculate, I wrote in this form that the information about dividends is missing.",Nofar Hamrany
